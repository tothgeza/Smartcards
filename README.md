# El Proyecte Grande - Production

## Story

As your Codecool Journey comes closer to its conclusion, the time has come for a final Teamwork Project, 
that will put to test all of the programming skills you've obtained so far (and some new ones you will learn on the way)!

You have the freedom of choosing your teammates (assemble a team of 3-4 students) and the project's topic this time.
Think of an app that you would find useful in your daily activities, a tool that an employee of a certain industry might crave,
a fun game or something completely out of the box.

This project is meant to last until the end of the course. While Codecool will not give you any direct tasks to fulfill regarding your project, 
during each sprint,you and your team are expected to make incremental changes in a Scrum way, developing the project further and further,
adding new features, technologies, etc.

***Â¡Comience El Proyecte Grande!***

## What are you going to learn?

- how to work in a Scrum team
- how to grow your project in an iterative manner
- how to deliver increments each sprint

## Tasks

1. The third phase (which lasts until the end of the module) focuses on developing your Product, based on the designs and prototype you have created previously.
    - All the requirements from tasks below are fulfilled during each sprint.

2. Utilize Scrum with your team throughout your project
    - A Daily Scrum is organized by the Scrum Master and lasts no longer than 10 minutes.
    - A Product Backlog is created by the Product Owner before the project work starts.
    - On Mondays, the Scrum Master organizes a Sprint Planning, which produces a Sprint Backlog.
    - The Sprint Backlog (and potentially the Product Backlog) is done with a tool, like Trello, JIRA, Azure Boards or Tara.
    - All tasks in the Sprint Backlog have a business value and a time estimation and are distributed among team members.
    - The Sprint Board consists of these task columns: TODO, In Progress, QA, Done.
    - Each team member, after finishing a task, puts it in the QA column and assigns an another team member to it. The assigned team member is then responsible for doing the Quality Assurance of that task - looking at the code and checking it for potential bugs and problems, and then testing the working feature.
    - If the QA process reveals no bugs or problems related to given task, the task gets put into the Done column.
    - If the QA process reveals bugs or problems related to given task, the task gets put back into the In Progress column  and reassigned to its original team member.
    - The project is consulted and reviewed by the Project Mentor at least once per sprint.
    - Every Friday, the team does a demo of their project, showcasing their progress and (if possible) their working prototypes. The demo is done regardless of how much or little progress the team has made during the last sprint.
    - Every Friday, after the demo, the Scrum Master organizes a Sprint Review meeting, during which the team investigates how much of the planned Sprint Backlog was fulfilled - and whether it well thought out and balanced for the team to handle.
    - Each Sprint Review produces an Increment Document - a changelog of sorts, listing out all the changes  to the product that are a result of this sprint.
    - Every Friday, after the Sprint Review, the Scrum Master organizes a Sprint Retrospective meeting, during which the team recalls on how the work went during this sprint, which practices were good, which should be improved and which should be stopped (and also what to introduce).
